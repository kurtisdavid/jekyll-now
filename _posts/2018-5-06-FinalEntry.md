### What did you like the least about the class?
I disliked the Java portion in the class, i.e., the refactoring. I felt like it was the only section that was not relevant to IDB, since our technology stack used only Python and JavaScript. It would have been nicer to have refactoring in Python, but unfortunately, the book was not set up like that.

### What did you like the most about the class?
The highlight of the class has to be the IDB project. As a group, we were able to pull off a fully functional API and dynamic website. In the process, we learned many tools and libraries to make it possible. Therefore, I believe students in the class get the most value from this aspect of course.

### What's the most significant thing you learned?
The most significant thing I learned was how to set up an API using only Flask and PostgreSQL. I did not realize that accessing an endpoint would be as simple as setting up the routing with Flask. In addition, because we did not use Flask-Restless, I got a chance to implement filtering in the API from scratch. These skills will come useful when I want to set up my own services as a side project because it is easy to set up and deploy.

### How many hours a week did you spend coding for this class?
I spent about 10-20 hours a week coding for the class whenever a project was due. However, because my group and I tended to procrastinate, it would only be for 1-2 weeks per project.

### How many hours a week did you spend reading for this class?
I spent 3 hours a week reading in the beginning, but as the semester became busier, those hours dropped to a flat 0. Granted, it would have made the quizzes easier, but some tradeoffs have to be made.

### How many lines of code do you think you wrote?
I probably wrote around 1000 lines of code for the project. 

### What required tool did you not know and now find very useful?
I did not know Travis CI, but it became an excellent tool when it came to deploying and testing our projects. The fact that we could automate tests and build everything on a similar computing setup helped us greatly in evaluating each build.

### What's the most useful Web dev tool that your group used that was not required?
Nothing on my end, but the member that wrote our Selenium tests loved this [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/katalon-recorder-selenium/ljdobmomdgdljniojadhoplhkpialdid?hl=en-US). It basically wrote our Selenium tests based on what we wanted to test on the website. Pretty neat!

### If you could change one thing about the course, what would it be?
Less focus on Java would be a great plus. If we spend the whole semester working on a web application that does not use Java, it does not make much sense to spend so much time using it.
