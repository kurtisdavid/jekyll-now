### What are your expectations of this class?

I expect this class to simulate what working in a team in industry will be like. Hopefully by the end of the course, I will be familiar with any future tools and processes I will be utilizing during my summer internship. I also hope to be more familiar with SQL, since it is one of the topics being covered in this class.
